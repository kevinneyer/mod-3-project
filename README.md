# ABOUT

The Divebar is a Single Page Application where users can view, review, and create 3 ingreditent or less cocktail recipes. Built using a Postgres database: https://github.com/kevinneyer/mod-3-project--backend, this app is a fun way to manipulate the DOM.

Once your backend server is running, use a new terminal to deploy the front end. Enter open index.html on the command line, and you're off.

Happy mixing!
